Firefox Addons Tests
====================

Automated tests for the Firefox Addons web application.

Running Tests
-------------

### Java
You will need a version of the [Java Runtime Environment][JRE] installed

[JRE]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

### Python
Before you will be able to run these tests you will need to have Python 2.6 installed.

Run

    easy_install pip

followed by

    sudo pip install -r requirements/mozwebqa.txt
    
__note__

If you are running on Ubuntu/Debian you will need to do following first

    sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
    
to install the required Python libraries.

### Selenium
Once this is all set up you will need to download and start a Selenium server. You can download the latest Selenium server from [here][Selenium Downloads]. The filename will be something like 'selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar'

To start the Selenium server run the following command:

    java -jar ~/Downloads/selenium-server-standalone-2.3.0.jar

Change the path/name to the downloaded Selenium server file.
